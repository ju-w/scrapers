Reflecting two emerging demographic trends----the increasing urbanization of Canada and the growth of high-rise neighbourhoods----Urban Digerati offers residents a vibrant vertical world, with bedrooms in the clouds and a lively social scene on the ground. Upper-middle-income, highly educated and culturally diverse, Urban Digerati neighbourhoods are typically filled with recently built high-rise apartments and condos located near fitness clubs, clothing boutiques and all types of bars----from wine to coffee to microbrew. Because many residents have yet to start families, they have the time and discretionary income to pursue active social lives, going dancing and bar-hopping, and hitting film festivals and food and wine shows. A group that likes to be viewed as trend-setters, they turn to online shopping to purchase the latest fashion and electronics. They also have made their health and wellness a priority, taking aerobics and Pilates classes. But they�re not simply acquisitive materialists; many are globally conscious consumers who support the arts and are actively involved in their communities.]]></whotheyare1><whotheyare2><![CDATA[In Urban Digerati, residents have used their higher education----more than half hold university degrees----to pursue technology- and information-intensive lifestyles. Their incomes, averaging above six figures, allow them to buy tech devices and download plenty of apps. These are the Canadians who sleep with their phones and go online to bank, shop, invest, look for a job and check out dating services. Digitally obsessed, they stay on top of the latest trends in popular culture by reading online magazines, restaurant guides and fashion and beauty blogs. But they haven�t completely abandoned traditional media, watching their favourite sports on TV and enjoying business and fashion magazines at strong rates. As a younger segment enjoying the excitement of urban life, they are a prime target for advertising placed in public transit stations, fitness centres, pubs and nightclubs.]]></whotheyare2><howtheythink><![CDATA[As might be expected with a younger and educated segment, members of Urban Digerati tend to hold a socially progressive view of the world and of family (Flexible Families, Racial Fusion). They believe that youth should be given the same privileges and responsibilities as adults, and they tend to have a more open-minded view of romantic relationships (Equal Relationship with Youth, Sexual Permissiveness). With higher education levels, they have learned to be critical thinkers and tend to question rules and authority (Rejection of Authority). Eager to learn from others, they like to express their individuality and seek out new and exciting experiences (Social Learning, Pursuit of Originality, Pursuit of Novelty). And their apartments are often appointed in the latest style in an effort to demonstrate their social standing (Ostentatious Consumption, Status via Home). Influential consumers for marketers, these young urbanites tend to be the early adopters of their peer group, shopping for new and flashy products that align with their interests (Consumption Evangelism, Enthusiasm for Technology, Importance of Aesthetics, Consumptivity).]]></howtheythink><wheretheylive><![CDATA[]]></wheretheylive><hot_leisure><![CDATA[health clubs
